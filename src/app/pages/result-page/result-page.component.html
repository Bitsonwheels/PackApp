    <p>While we're in Alpha testing, you can only build debug build APKs, for testing purposes. These cannot be
      released
      on Google Play. Soon we'll enable you to build release-ready, digitally signed production builds for release on
      Google Play and other stores. There is likely to be a small fee for this.</p>
    <p>If you want to be contacted when this feature is available (and get an early adopter's discount), submit your
      email below.</p>
